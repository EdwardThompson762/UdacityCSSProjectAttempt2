			<p>The Dog is one of the most important animals on this planet. 
				They have lived alongside humans for thousands of years.
				Serving as guards of our flocks of sheep, herds of cows.
				Warning us with their sharp sense of smell. 
				The world would be a lot less special without our furry dog friends.
